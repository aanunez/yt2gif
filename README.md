# yt2gif
Downloads a youtube video, turns it into a gif with optional subtitles.

Based on [this](https://github.com/1-Sisyphe/youCanCodeAGif). WIP. Lots of the code is still under their MIT license, but I'm expecting to eventually overhaul everything. 

#### Examples

Create a rick and morty gif from RTJ's Oh Mama

    python3 -m yt2gif -u "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBYsx1QWF9A" -c 00:01:53.0-00:01:54.2
    
   
#### Bugs/todo

* Move to a real temp structure
* Finish that gif for my friend jessie
* Make sure this can actually be installed and used
* General clean up of yt2gif
* Try to make it work on windows
